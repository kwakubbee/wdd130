            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                It all began with a river and a dream.

                In the summer of 1998, three childhood friends—Kwakubbee, Jake, and Kwame—stood at the edge of the
                roaring Whitepine River,their paddles in hand and hearts full of wanderlust. They had spent years
                exploring rivers across
                continents, from the
                lush rapids of Ghana’s Volta to the icy flows of the Pacific Northwest. But it was that one
                unforgettable ride down
                Whitepine that sparked something bigger: a vision to share the joy of river life with others.

                With little more than a secondhand raft, a rusty pickup, and a lot of heart, they launched Happy
                Riders—a name inspired
                by the laughter and camaraderie they saw on every trip. Word spread quickly. Locals came for the thrill,
                stayed for the
                stories, and returned with friends. Over time, Happy Riders grew from a weekend passion into a
                full-fledged rafting
                company known for its safety, soul, and signature blend of adventure and hospitality.

                Today, Happy Riders is more than just a rafting company. It’s a community of explorers, nature-lovers,
                and
                thrill-seekers who believe that every river has a story—and every rider deserves a happy one.
