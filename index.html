            Ghana is a country located on the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa. It is relatively small in area and
            population, but is
            celebrated for its rich history. The capital of Ghana is the coastal city of Accra. The country is
            multiethnic, with
            inhabitants including the Akan, Mossi, Ewe, and Ga-Adangme peoples. Ghana spans diverse ecologies, from
            coastal savannas
            to tropical rain forests. It is one of the most stable and democratic countries in West Africa.
