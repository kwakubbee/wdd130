            <p>
                My name is Bright Kwaku Boateng, a 39-year-old Ghanaian with a deep appreciation for hard work, culture,
                and adventure.
                I currently work 12-hour shifts at Sentuo Oil Refinery, where I bring dedication and resilience to every
                task. When I’m
                not at the refinery, I retreat to my farm—my personal haven—where I reconnect with nature and cultivate
                the land with
                care.

                I’m also pursuing a degree in Software Engineering through BYU Pathway, driven by a passion for
                technology and a desire
                to build solutions that make life better. Balancing work, study, and farm life isn’t easy, but I thrive
                on the challenge
                and the growth it brings.

                Culturally, I’m rooted in Ghana’s vibrant spirit. I love Hip-life music—it’s the rhythm of my soul and a
                soundtrack to
                many of my days. My favorite dish is eba with palaba sauce, a meal that always reminds me of home and
                heritage.

                Beyond the everyday, I’m someone who dreams big. I love swimming and would love to try skydiving one
                day—because life is
                meant to be felt deeply and lived boldly. Japan is high on my travel list, with its rich traditions,
                futuristic cities,
                and serene landscapes calling to me.

                I’m a man of many layers: a worker, a student, a farmer, a dreamer. And I believe that with grit and
                grace, anything is
                possible

                Ghana is a country located on the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa. It is relatively small in area and
                population, but is
                celebrated for its rich history. The capital of Ghana is the coastal city of Accra. The country is
                multiethnic, with
                inhabitants including the Akan, Mossi, Ewe, and Ga-Adangme peoples. Ghana spans diverse ecologies, from
                coastal savannas
                to tropical rain forests. It is one of the most stable and democratic countries in West Africa.
